# *m = num methods, *p = num proxied calls

# loadSchemas has most of the Schema, SystemKeyspace & DefsTables references, SystemKeyspace is also referenced in isReplacing
# move loadSchemas to Schema or SystemKeyspace

DatabaseDescriptor [Schema(?, 3m), SystemKeyspace(?, 2m), DefsTables(?, 1m), KeyspaceManager]  #seems to be logical initialization point
    * move loadSchemas to SystemKeyspace
    * pass SystemKeyspace into isReplacing

QueryProcessor []  # maintains prepared statements, but has no dependencies
Updated --> TriggerExecutor [QueryProcessor]

SinkManager []
StorageServiceTasks []
StreamManager [DatabaseDescriptor]

Schema [SystemKeyspace(?, 1m), MigrationManager(?, 1m)]
    * pass SystemKeyspace into updateVersion method
    * pass MigrationManager into updateVersionAndAnnounce (called by DefsTables, StorageService)
    * move static initialization stuff into static factory method

Updated --> CommitLog [DatabaseDescriptor, KeyspaceManager, Schema]
Updated --> CommitLogSegmentManager [DatabaseDescriptor, KeyspaceManager, Schema]
    * do something about the KeyspaceManager dependency

SystemKeyspace [ClusterState, Schema(weak, 1m finishStartup), QueryProcessor(strong), DatabaseDescriptor(strong)]
    * replace StorageService.getPartitioner gets with DatabaseDescriptor.getPartitioner
    * pass schema instance into finishStartup

DefsTables [SystemKeyspace, Schema, MigrationManager(med), CompactionManager(weak, 2), CommitLog(weak, 1)]

StageManager [DatabaseDescriptor, MessagingService(weak, 1m, parameterize)]

MessagingService [StorageServiceTasks, StageManager(stronger, 2m), StorageProxy(weak, 1m), DatabaseDescriptor, SinkManager, Tracing]
    * work out how to decouple the MessagingService and StageManager constructors
        * could push incrementDroppedMessages from MessagingService to DatabaseDescriptor, but that's kinda messy
        * could special case tracingexecutor to live in an atomic reference outside the enum map and expose a setter
        * could push getStage up to DatabaseDescriptor, also ugly
        * could use a wrapper class for the timeoutReporter, which references a volatile member

Gossiper [MessagingService, DatabaseDescriptor, FailureDetector(?), StorageService(?), StageManager]
    * move failure detector registration out of constructor and into static factory
    * DI other FailureDetector dependent methods (3)
    * move valueFactory from StorageService to ClusterState to remove dependency

              FailureDetector(2m), SinkManager(2m), Gossiper(4m), ClusterState]
    * maybe remove dependency on StorageService(getPartitioner, TokenMetadata, getNaturalEndpoints, getLiveNaturalEndpoints)
    * move isBootstrapMode to ClusterState to remove dependency on StorageService

Updated --> Tracing [StageManager, StorageProxy]

ColumnFamilyStoreManager [Schema, ClusterState, SystemKeyspace, CompactionManager, CacheService]
ColumnFamilyStore [ClusterState, SystemKeyspace, CompactionManager, CacheService, ColumnFamilyStoreManager.TaskExecutors]

                FailureDetector(5m), ActiveRepairService(very strong), ColumnFamilyStoreManager(create), KeyspaceManager]

    * resolve dependency on KeyspaceManager
    * split out getValidColumnFamilies, forceKeyspaceFlush
