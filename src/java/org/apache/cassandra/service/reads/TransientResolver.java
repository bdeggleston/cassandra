/**
 * We need to do a few things with digest reads that include transient data
 * 1. send repairs to full replicas if the transient replica has data they don't
 * 2. forward repair mutations to full replicas that sent digest responses (and therefore
 *    weren't involved in the data resolution process)
 * 3. in cases where we receive multiple full data responses from a speculative retry, avoid
 *    comparing data responses we already know are identical from the digest comparisons
 * 4. don't add any overhead to non-transient reads
 * 5. Use the same responses in the data resolution used in the digest comparisons
 *
 * This class assumes that all of the responses from full replicas agreed on their data (otherwise
 * we'd be doing a normal foreground repair)
